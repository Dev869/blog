<h2 id="race-summary">Race Summary</h2>

<p>The first lap was pretty chill, except for the one guy who nearly slid out on the first lap it went pretty smooth. The next few laps it definitely picked up a bit and I lost a lot of positions. After about 4 laps I found myself at the back of the pack and ultimately ended up being gapped off the group and that was the end of my race.</p>

<p><strong>Things to Work On</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Stay up front</li>
  <li>Don’t let wheels go</li>
  <li>Eat more during the race</li>
  <li>Get more sleep before the race</li>
  <li>Make sure to not lose the wheel coming out of corners as it will pick up speed really quick.</li>
</ul>
