<p>Being a rider from California and traveling to the other side of the world in Belgium take its toll on the body. Going from Ontario, CA -&gt; Dallas, TX -&gt; London, UK -&gt; Brussels, Belgium isn‚Äôt a super easy trip to endure. There‚Äôs a lot more to take into account than you‚Äôd think. While you may have gone to Europe in the past to vacation, you have to keep in mind that getting over the jet lag is only one of the many hoops to jump through. Being unexceptionally small (54kgs and 5‚Äô7‚Äù), I have to really be on top of eating and drinking enough - though this probably goes the same for most cyclists. I‚Äôm just typically bad at nutrition, so that was quite the struggle for me in the 25 hour trip across the globe.</p>
