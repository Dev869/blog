<p>This is the first time Iâ€™ve mentioned it, but today is Syrah &amp; Iâ€™s 7 month milestone. As one can imagine maintaining a relationship overseas isnâ€™t the easiest thing in the world, but we manage. Normally Iâ€™m studying up in Davis and sheâ€™s back at home in Redlands so weâ€™re used to distance, just not the time difference. What I havenâ€™t really discussed much is how a relationship may impact performance as well. In training, every detail counts - and the stress of a long distance relationship, to me, is nothing trivial. So thatâ€™s something I have to consider when recovering and preparing for races in addition to maintaining basic mental health needs. We make sure to continue to communicate despite the 9 hour difference beteen California and Oudenaarde, so that keeps us sane for the most part. Having luxuries like Facetime and texting is definitely a must and something I am very thankful for.</p>

<p>While Iâ€™ve only done 4 races and complleted one of them, weâ€™re almost already half way through the camp. Time flies I guess when youâ€™re racing and riding in a foreign country, though being away from my significant other for so long does make things drag a bit too. In about an hour from writing this Iâ€™ll be headed to my fifth race of the trip in Gistel, so Iâ€™m just hoping that goes well.</p>
