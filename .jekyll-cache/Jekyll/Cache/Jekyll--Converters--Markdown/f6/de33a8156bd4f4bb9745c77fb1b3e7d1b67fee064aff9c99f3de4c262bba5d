<p>Hi I am <strong>Devin Wilson</strong>. I am an undergraduate CS student at University of California, Davis as well as a competetive cyclist currently racing for Team California in the DET ranks. In addition to my life as a student and a cylist, I enjoy taking photos on the side as a sort of creative outlet.</p>
