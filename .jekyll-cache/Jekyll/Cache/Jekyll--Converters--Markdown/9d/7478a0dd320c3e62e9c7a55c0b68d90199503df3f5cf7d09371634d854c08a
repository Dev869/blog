<p>Yeah, not the greatest. Iâ€™m not even sure what it is to be honest. Took a rapid covid test and it came out 100% negative so signs point to no covid. Nonetheless covid or no covid illness still exists and itâ€™ll still put a damper on riding and racing. Unfortunately I donâ€™t think itâ€™d be a great idea to just ride it out and keep training through the sickness. In the past Iâ€™ve attempted to just ignore any signs of being sick and all that did was make me even more ill and delay my recoveryâ€¦ so the best thing I can do is to be super careful and to keep myself well fed, resting and focusing on getting better in order to get back to training and racing. Itâ€™d really suck to try and get back into it too soon and end up being sick the whole duration of the camp. Thatâ€™d be no fun at all.</p>
