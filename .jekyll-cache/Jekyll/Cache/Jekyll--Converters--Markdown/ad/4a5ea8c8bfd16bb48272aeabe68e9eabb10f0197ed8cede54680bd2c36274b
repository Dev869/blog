<h2 id="race-summary">Race Summary</h2>

<p>Started out chill-ish like the day before but for more of a half lap than a full lap. Super punchy especially with this one screaming descent into a sharp left-hander. Then a bit later on there was this really difficult 3 minute climb we’d rip up every lap. Super fun, but also super hard. With that kind of effort every lap I hung in for about an hour which I believe was 6 laps. Even though I was much better about positioning today I was losing wheels out of the insanely punchy climbs simply because I could not hold the wheel. I guess I have yet to get that sort of effort into my legs.</p>
