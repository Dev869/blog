## Race Summary

I stayed in the whole race this time :) . It was pretty flat and more similar to a lot of crits that I've done in SoCal, so I was able to be a bit more comfortable. What I didn't expect however was how split up everything got. In the last few laps the race totally split up with riders all several minutes apart from one another and it looked like quite the frenzy. Something to expect for the next time around.
