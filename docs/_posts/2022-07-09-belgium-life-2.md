## Well shit, I got sick (I think?)
Yeah, not the greatest. I'm not even sure what it is to be honest. Took a rapid covid test and it came out 100% negative so signs point to no covid. Nonetheless covid or no covid illness still exists and it'll still put a damper on riding and racing. Unfortunately I don't think it'd be a great idea to just ride it out and keep training through the sickness. In the past I've attempted to just ignore any signs of being sick and all that did was make me even more ill and delay my recovery... so the best thing I can do is to be super careful and to keep myself well fed, resting and focusing on getting better in order to get back to training and racing. It'd really suck to try and get back into it too soon and end up being sick the whole duration of the camp. That'd be no fun at all.

### What I'm doing now
- Resting
- Resting
- More rest
- Eating
- Sleeping
- Drinking
- Worrying about not getting other people sick
- Wallowing in the self pity of being sick in Belgium when I'm supposed to be racing

*In any case, I'll see y'all later.*
