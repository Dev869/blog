## Some things don't have to be cycling related

This is the first time I've mentioned it, but today is Syrah & I's 7 month milestone. As one can imagine maintaining a relationship overseas isn't the easiest thing in the world, but we manage. Normally I'm studying up in Davis and she's back at home in Redlands so we're used to distance, just not the time difference. What I haven't really discussed much is how a relationship may impact performance as well. In training, every detail counts - and the stress of a long distance relationship, to me, is nothing trivial. So that's something I have to consider when recovering and preparing for races in addition to maintaining basic mental health needs. We make sure to continue to communicate despite the 9 hour difference beteen California and Oudenaarde, so that keeps us sane for the most part. Having luxuries like Facetime and texting is definitely a must and something I am very thankful for.

## Almost half way there

While I've only done 4 races and complleted one of them, we're almost already half way through the camp. Time flies I guess when you're racing and riding in a foreign country, though being away from my significant other for so long does make things drag a bit too. In about an hour from writing this I'll be headed to my fifth race of the trip in Gistel, so I'm just hoping that goes well.
